                    Our mission is to provide a supportive and engaging community for high school students to learn, grow, and develop their skills in Python programming, data structures, and algorithms. We organize a variety of events and activities to help our members succeed, including coding challenges, workshops, and mentorship programs. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced student, we have something for everyone.

                    Our activities include weekly meetings, workshops, hackathons, guest speakers, and project showcases. Hackathons are 24-hour coding competitions where teams work together to solve complex problems. We also invite guest speakers to come and talk to us about their experiences in the tech industry and the skills and knowledge that are most important for success in that field. In addition to our technical activities, we also have a strong focus on community service and giving back to our school and community.

                    We organize our own project showcases where members can showcase their work and get feedback from their peers. These project showcases are a great way for our members to apply their skills in a real-world context and to learn from each other. We believe that giving back to our community is an important part of being a responsible member of society and we strive to make a positive impact in any way we can.
